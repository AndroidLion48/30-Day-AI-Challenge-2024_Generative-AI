# Day 8 – Summarize Anything In Seconds

### 📝 Challenge Summary
Summarize long articles, PDFs, and transcripts into concise takeaways with citations or quotes. Practice prompt patterns for length and fidelity.

### 🧩 Why This Helps Later
- Build reusable prompt patterns and checklists you can re‑apply.
- Learn tool strengths/limits so you can pick the right one fast.
- Create artifacts (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later.
- Tighten a habit of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- ChatGPT / Claude (summaries)
- Perplexity (linked summaries)
- PDF tools (OCR if needed)

### 🧪 Suggested Workflow
1. Define the objective and constraints (time, budget, quality).
2. Draft a first pass with an AI tool.
3. Iterate 2–3 times: tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs.
4. Export/share and note issues for next time.

### 🗣 Prompt Starters
- Summarize this article in 7 bullet points with 2 direct quotes and a 1‑sentence TL;DR.
- List contradictions or gaps across the top 3 sources.

### ✅ Evaluation Checklist
- Did I define success criteria before generating?
- Did I compare outputs across 2 tools or settings?
- Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

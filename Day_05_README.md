# Day 5 – Create Music and Songs

### 📝 Challenge Summary

Compose short tracks or jingles from text prompts. Experiment with mood, tempo, genre, and lyrics to understand music tokens and structure.

### 🧩 Why This Helps Later

- **Build reusable prompt patterns** and checklists you can re‑apply
- **Learn tool strengths/limits** so you can pick the right one fast
- **Create artifacts** (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later
- **Tighten a habit** of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs

### 🛠 Tools Used

- **Suno** / **Udio** (music gen)
- **Mubert** / **Soundful** / **AIVA**
- **ChatGPT** (lyrics)

### 🧪 Suggested Workflow

1. **Define the objective and constraints** (time, budget, quality)
2. **Draft a first pass** with an AI tool
3. **Iterate 2–3 times:** tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs
4. **Export/share** and note issues for next time

### 🗣 Prompt Starters

- Draft a first version that meets the objective
- Critique it and propose 3 improvements. Then apply them

### ✅ Evaluation Checklist

- [x] Did I define success criteria before generating?
- [x] Did I compare outputs across 2+ tools or settings?
- [x] Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- [x] Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

### ✍️ My Learnings

#### What surprised me

1. How easy Suno was to use, and the high quality of music it produces
2. Mubert generated good to ok background music, but it ruined the track by randomly saying Mubert throughout it. This may be to ensure clients purchase the premium version
3. Soundful GUI reminded me of Spotify. I had a really hard time finding where and how to produce my own tracks. The website goes way over board showing examples and genres you can create. It also felt extremely restrictive with its creative capabilities due to the way the UI is designed. Ex. I couldn't find Blues as a genre

#### What I struggled with

1. Using Soundful was truly a struggle compared to the other AI's. The restrictive nature of the UI made using it feel like a chore

#### What I'll do differently next time

1. Play around with Suno more. I really enjoyed this AI

### 📎 Extras

#### Links, presets, or files I used

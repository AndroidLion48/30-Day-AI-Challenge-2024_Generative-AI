# Day 6 – Create Compelling Videos

## 📝 Challenge Summary

Turn a short script into a video using AI generation and smart editing. Learn beats, shot prompts, transitions, subtitles, and B‑roll creation.

## 🧩 Why This Helps Later

- **Build reusable prompt patterns** and checklists you can re‑apply
- **Learn tool strengths/limits** so you can pick the right one fast
- **Create artifacts** (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later
- **Tighten a habit** of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Runway** / **Pika** / **Kaiber** (video gen)
- **CapCut** / **Descript** / **Lumen5** (editing)
- **ChatGPT** (script)

## 🧪 Suggested Workflow

1. **Define the objective and constraints** (time, budget, quality)
2. **Draft a first pass** with an AI tool
3. **Iterate 2–3 times:** tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs
4. **Export/share** and note issues for next time

## 🗣 Prompt Starters

- Turn this script into a 30‑sec video outline with 5 shots and captions
- Suggest B‑roll prompts and text overlays for a punchy hook

## ✅ Evaluation Checklist

- [x] Did I define success criteria before generating?
- [x] Did I compare outputs across 2+ tools or settings?
- [x] Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- [x] Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

## ✍️ My Learnings

### What surprised me

1. **Runway** required me to subscribe to the service before it created a video clip, though it did produce a nice image
2. **Descript** generated videos quickly and had a very easy-to-use UI interface

### What I struggled with

1. When attempting to make a short video clip with **Runway**, it created a wonderful image but required me to subscribe in order to make a video
2. I took the image generated with Runway and uploaded it to **Kaiber**, but this AI required a paid trial to create a video
3. I took the image generated with Runway and uploaded it to **Pika** for it to be utilized as a reference to create a short video. This site took a really long time generating the video
4. I took the image generated with Runway and uploaded it to **Descript**; the video generated quickly and the AI's UI was very easy to use

### What I'll do differently next time

1. Using Runway for images will be a starting point. I really enjoyed the image it created. I would then go immediately to Descript for the video generation

# Day 6 – Create Compelling Videos

### 📝 Challenge Summary
Turn a short script into a video using AI generation and smart editing. Learn beats, shot prompts, transitions, subtitles, and B‑roll creation.

### 🧩 Why This Helps Later
- Build reusable prompt patterns and checklists you can re‑apply.
- Learn tool strengths/limits so you can pick the right one fast.
- Create artifacts (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later.
- Tighten a habit of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Runway / Pika / Kaiber (video gen)
- CapCut / Descript / Lumen5 (editing)
- ChatGPT (script)

### 🧪 Suggested Workflow
1. Define the objective and constraints (time, budget, quality).
2. Draft a first pass with an AI tool.
3. Iterate 2–3 times: tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs.
4. Export/share and note issues for next time.

### 🗣 Prompt Starters
- Turn this script into a 30‑sec video outline with 5 shots and captions.
- Suggest B‑roll prompts and text overlays for a punchy hook.

### ✅ Evaluation Checklist
- Did I define success criteria before generating?
- Did I compare outputs across 2 tools or settings?
- Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

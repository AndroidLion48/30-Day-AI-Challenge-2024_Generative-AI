# Day 1 – Create Your Own Stock Images

### 📝 Challenge Summary
Generate bespoke, stock‑style images with AI instead of paying for generic stock. Practice prompt design, iterate for composition and style, and export usable assets for blogs, apps, and decks.

### 🧩 Why This Helps Later
- Build reusable prompt patterns and checklists you can re‑apply.
- Learn tool strengths/limits so you can pick the right one fast.
- Create artifacts (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later.
- Tighten a habit of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- ChatGPT (prompt refining)
- DALL·E / Midjourney / Stable Diffusion
- Adobe Firefly
- Bing Image Creator

### 🧪 Suggested Workflow
1. Define the objective and constraints (time, budget, quality).
2. Draft a first pass with an AI tool.
3. Iterate 2–3 times: tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs.
4. Export/share and note issues for next time.

### 🗣 Prompt Starters
- Create a [style] stock photo of [subject], shot on [lens/focal length], [lighting], [color palette].
- Generate 4 variations with different compositions: rule‑of‑thirds, centered, wide, close‑up.

### ✅ Evaluation Checklist
- Did I define success criteria before generating?
- Did I compare outputs across 2 tools or settings?
- Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

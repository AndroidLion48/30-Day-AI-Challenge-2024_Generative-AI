# Day 18 – Supercharged Brainstorming With Generative AI

### 📝 Challenge Summary
Rapid ideation: go wide, cluster themes, then go deep. Use mind maps and constraints to turn sparks into testable concepts.

### 🧩 Why This Helps Later
- Build reusable prompt patterns and checklists you can re‑apply.
- Learn tool strengths/limits so you can pick the right one fast.
- Create artifacts (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later.
- Tighten a habit of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- ChatGPT (idea generation)
- Miro / FigJam / Whimsical (maps)
- Perplexity (signals & examples)

### 🧪 Suggested Workflow
1. Define the objective and constraints (time, budget, quality).
2. Draft a first pass with an AI tool.
3. Iterate 2–3 times: tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs.
4. Export/share and note issues for next time.

### 🗣 Prompt Starters
- Brainstorm 20 ideas for [goal]. Cluster them into 5 themes and pick 2 to develop.
- For idea X, list assumptions, quick tests, and a 1‑week experiment plan.

### ✅ Evaluation Checklist
- Did I define success criteria before generating?
- Did I compare outputs across 2 tools or settings?
- Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

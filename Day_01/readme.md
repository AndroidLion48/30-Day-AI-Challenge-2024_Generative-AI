Day 1 – Create Your Own Stock Images – 30 Day AI Challenge 2024


Introduction to Today’s Challenge: Creating Stock Images

Why pay for Stock Images when you can create your own custom images that do the job better? Creating your own stock images sounds like a task reserved for professional photographers and designers, right? Wrong. With the rise of Generative AI, the power to create stunning, high-quality images is now at everyone’s fingertips. Today’s challenge is all about unleashing your inner artist and creating custom stock images without the need for a professional setup or years of design experience. 

Summary: 

    Choose Your Subject: Start with a clear idea of the image you want to create. Whether it’s a serene landscape, a bustling city scene, or abstract art, having a specific concept will guide your creation.
    Pick an AI Tool: For beginners and those looking for free tools, Bing Image Creator, Adobe Firefly, Stable Diffusion, Google Gemini and Dall-E 3 (integrated with ChatGPT) offer an intuitive interface, while tools like Leonardo.ai provide more advanced options with detailed prompts. Most tools offer free credits or limited daily image generations to try things out.
    Craft Your Prompt: This is crucial. The more detailed your prompt, the better your results. Include aspects like setting, mood, main objects, colors, and style.
    Iterate: Don’t settle for your first result. Play around with different prompts and settings to see how slight changes can affect the outcome.
    Use it Responsibly: Remember, the images you create should be used ethically, respecting copyright laws, personal rights and labelling / disclosure where necessary. Also check the usage rights associated with different platforms…for example some sites only allow for commercial use if you’re on a paid plan (in most cases still cheaper and better than buying stock photos).

# Day 1 – Create Your Own Stock Images

## 📝 Challenge Summary

Generate bespoke, stock-style images with AI instead of paying for generic stock. Practice prompt design, iterate for composition and style, and export usable assets for blogs, apps, and decks.

## 🧩 Why This Helps Later

- **Build reusable prompt patterns** and checklists you can re-apply
- **Learn tool strengths/limits** so you can pick the right one fast
- **Create artifacts** (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later
- **Tighten a habit** of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **ChatGPT** (prompt refining)
- **DALL·E** / **Midjourney** / **Stable Diffusion**
- **Adobe Firefly**
- **Bing Image Creator**

## 🧪 Suggested Workflow

1. **Define the objective and constraints** (time, budget, quality)
2. **Draft a first pass** with an AI tool
3. **Iterate 2–3 times:** tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs
4. **Export/share** and note issues for next time

## 🗣 Prompt Starters

- Create a `[style]` stock photo of `[subject]`, shot on `[lens/focal length]`, `[lighting]`, `[color palette]`
- Generate 4 variations with different compositions: rule-of-thirds, centered, wide, close-up

## ✅ Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Did I define success criteria before generating?
- [ ] Did I compare outputs across 2+ tools or settings?
- [ ] Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- [ ] Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

## ✍️ My Learnings

### What surprised me

The difference in quality when comparing the output of each tool was interesting. For instance (I copied and pasted the same prompt):

1. **Bing Image Creator** produced a variety of images but also tended to add unwanted words to the image, while hallucinating their spelling more often than not
2. **DALL-E** produced 3 to 4 images per prompt and their quality was noticeably better than the base Bing images
3. **Adobe Firefly** (premium image generation) only allowed one free image generation. This was by far the best in terms of understanding the intent of the prompt and producing a truly high-quality vivid image that captures attention and the imagination

### What I struggled with

Initially my prompts were too long and contained too much detail. This would lead to a greater chance of hallucinating. Utilizing an accompanying AI like ChatGPT or Gemini were great tools to summarize an image idea into a solid prompt for another image generator.

### What I'll do differently next time

I will make my prompts more precise to avoid AI hallucination.

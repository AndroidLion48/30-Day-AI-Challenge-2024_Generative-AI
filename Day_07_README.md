# Day 7 – Create YouTube Shorts, Insta Reels, TikTok Videos

### 📝 Challenge Summary
Repurpose or create vertical short‑form clips with auto‑captions, beatsync, and hooks in the first 2 seconds. Optimize for platform norms.

### 🧩 Why This Helps Later
- Build reusable prompt patterns and checklists you can re‑apply.
- Learn tool strengths/limits so you can pick the right one fast.
- Create artifacts (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later.
- Tighten a habit of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- CapCut (templates + captions)
- OpusClip / VEED (reframing & clips)
- Descript (voice/clips)

### 🧪 Suggested Workflow
1. Define the objective and constraints (time, budget, quality).
2. Draft a first pass with an AI tool.
3. Iterate 2–3 times: tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs.
4. Export/share and note issues for next time.

### 🗣 Prompt Starters
- Draft a first version that meets the objective.
- Critique it and propose 3 improvements. Then apply them.

### ✅ Evaluation Checklist
- Did I define success criteria before generating?
- Did I compare outputs across 2 tools or settings?
- Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

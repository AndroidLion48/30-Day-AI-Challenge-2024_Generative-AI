# Day 2 – Level Up Your Storytelling

## 📝 Challenge Summary

Craft a personalized bedtime story using an LLM to brainstorm, draft, and refine plot, then add AI visuals or narration. Focus on tone control, structure, and collaboration with the model.

## 🧩 Why This Helps Later

- **Build reusable prompt patterns** and checklists you can re-apply
- **Learn tool strengths/limits** so you can pick the right one fast
- **Create artifacts** (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later
- **Tighten a habit** of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **ChatGPT** / **Gemini** (story drafts)
- **Pi** (conversational ideation)
- **ElevenLabs** or **TTS Maker** (audio narration)
- **Midjourney** / **DALL·E** (illustrations)

## 🧪 Suggested Workflow

1. **Define the objective and constraints** (time, budget, quality)
2. **Draft a first pass** with an AI tool
3. **Iterate 2–3 times:** tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs
4. **Export/share** and note issues for next time

## 🗣 Prompt Starters

- Write a 500-word bedtime story in the style of `[author]` about `[characters]` who `[conflict]`
- Suggest 3 endings with different tones: cozy, bittersweet, adventurous

## ✅ Evaluation Checklist

- [x] Did I define success criteria before generating?
- [x] Did I compare outputs across 2+ tools or settings?
- [x] Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- [x] Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?

## ✍️ My Learnings

### What surprised me

1. The idea back and forth conversation with Pi really did help to create a story I was satisfied with
2. I did not expect Pi to be so restrictive with access to viewing past prompt inputs. I was only able to see my 2 or 3 prompts depending on how large the AI's response was

### What I struggled with

1. Not having the ability to freely view past prompts in the way a lot of mainstream AI's like ChatGPT and Gemini will allow

### What I'll do differently next time

1. I know now that you can simply navigate your browser backwards and immediately forward again. This will make your entire conversation visible. Other you will have to pay for this simple feature

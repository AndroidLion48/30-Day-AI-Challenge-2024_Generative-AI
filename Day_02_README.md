# Day 2 – Level Up Your Storytelling

### 📝 Challenge Summary
Craft a personalized bedtime story using an LLM to brainstorm, draft, and refine plot, then add AI visuals or narration. Focus on tone control, structure, and collaboration with the model.

### 🧩 Why This Helps Later
- Build reusable prompt patterns and checklists you can re‑apply.
- Learn tool strengths/limits so you can pick the right one fast.
- Create artifacts (images, scripts, docs) you can remix later.
- Tighten a habit of scoping, iterating, and evaluating outputs.

### 🛠 Tools Used
- ChatGPT / Gemini (story drafts)
- Pi (conversational ideation)
- ElevenLabs or TTS Maker (audio narration)
- Midjourney / DALL·E (illustrations)

### 🧪 Suggested Workflow
1. Define the objective and constraints (time, budget, quality).
2. Draft a first pass with an AI tool.
3. Iterate 2–3 times: tighten prompts, adjust parameters, compare outputs.
4. Export/share and note issues for next time.

### 🗣 Prompt Starters
- Write a 500‑word bedtime story in the style of [author] about [characters] who [conflict].
- Suggest 3 endings with different tones: cozy, bittersweet, adventurous.

### ✅ Evaluation Checklist
- Did I define success criteria before generating?
- Did I compare outputs across 2 tools or settings?
- Did I capture sources or parameters for reproducibility?
- Did I write 2–3 notes on what to try differently next time?
